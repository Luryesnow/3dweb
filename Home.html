        <p>About:</p>
        <p>Once the home of Walther and Wilhelmina von Hallwyl.

            Walther and Wilhelmina took their daily meals in The Dining Room as well as when entertaining. They were often three at the table, as the ladyâ€™s companion Ida Uhse dined with them. On festive occasions the table would be set for more people. The table could be extended and seat about 30 guests.
            
            The reception rooms are all decorated in the historicist manner, meaning that the rooms are inspired by different historical periods. The Dining Room is decorated in the Baroque style. It is a somber style suitable for formal dinners.
            
            The walls are panelled in oak with details of black bog oak.
            
            The images for this project were captured using an array of four Panasonic Lumix GX8 cameras.</p>
